Take-Pong-Me
============

A take on Pong.  The play field is very narrow to allow for quick scoring (and for the window to be somewhat incognito.)  Game ends when the AI scores 10 points.  As your score counter is not capped, your goal is to beat your old high score before the game ends.  Once your score you have beaten your score, your counter turns orange in celebration.  Special thanks goes to Anna Anthropy (http://www.auntiepixelante.com/), as this game uses her Bubble Butts mono-spaced font.
